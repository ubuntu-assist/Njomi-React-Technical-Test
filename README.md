# Getting Started

## Brief

URL shortening is a technique on the Web in which a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) may be made substantially shorter and still direct to the required page. This is achieved by using a redirect that links to the web page that has a long URL. For example, the URL [https://example.com/assets/category_B/subcategory_C/Foo/](https://example.com/assets/category_B/subcategory_C/Foo/) can be shortened to [https://shrtlnk.dev/5k9ook](https://shrtlnk.dev/5k9ook), and the URL [http://example.com/about/index.html](http://example.com/about/index.html) can be shortened to [https://shrtlnk.dev/4733wz](https://shrtlnk.dev/4733wz).

## Requirements

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)

## Quickstart

```
git clone https://github.com/weshare237/Njomi-Frontend-Technical-Test
cd Njomi-Laravel-Frontend-Technical-Test
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Optional Gitpod

If you can't or don't want to run and install locally, you can work with this repo in Gitpod. If you do this, you can skip the `clone this repo` part.
